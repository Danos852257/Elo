    Welcome to [website name]<br>
    By Daniel Kahdian<br>
    This site is a decision making app that simplifies complicated decisions into 2 choices<br><br>

    HOW TO USE<br>
    Create an account and you can start making rankings<br>
    Click on New Ranking and fill out the name and competitors field<br>
    Each new line is a separate competitor, so don't put them on the same line with commas<br>
    Put them on different lines<br>
    Then click on the ranking and choose whichever option you think is better<br>
    The Elo algorithm determines the rankings<br>
    Learn more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details<br>
    <br>
    You can use the app for pretty much anything, including favorite color, book, major, college, movie, etc<br><br>
